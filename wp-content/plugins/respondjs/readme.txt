The goal of this script is to provide a fast and lightweight (3kb minified / 1kb gzipped) script to enable [responsive web designs](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/) in browsers that don't support CSS3 Media Queries - in particular, Internet Explorer 8 and under. It's written in such a way that it will probably patch support for other non-supporting browsers as well (more information on that soon).

= How to get it working =

- Craft your CSS with min/max-width media queries to adapt your layout from mobile (first) all the way up to desktop
- Follow each of your media query closing braces with this closing comment (handy for scanning the stylesheet anyway, IMHO):

<pre>
    @media screen and (min-width: 480px){
        ...styles for 480px and up go here
    }/*/mediaquery*/
</pre>
 
== Installation ==
